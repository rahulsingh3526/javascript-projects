let sumEl = document.getElementById("sum-el")

function add(){
let result = num1 + num2
sumEl.textContent = "Sum : " + result
}







let sumEl = doocumnet.getElementById("sum-el"). textContent

function add() {
let result = num1 + num2
sumEl = "Sum: " + result
}






In the first screenshot, sumEl a variable, assigned to a HTML element.
You then take that variable and modify its textContent on line 17. 

In the second screenshot, sumEl is assigned to a HTML elements textContent.
You modify the variable to be something else on line 17. 
You don't modify the HTML element, because the variable no longer points to it.
